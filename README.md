# aws-cloudFormation

The AWS CloudFormation repository contains a collection of sample AWS CloudFormation templates that can be used to deploy AWS resources in an automated and repeatable manner. The templates are organized by categories, such as networking, security, compute, and storage, and cover a wide range of AWS services and scenarios.

## Cloud Challenge
A Challenge Question to Create a Cloud Formation template that provisions a VPC with its necessary components and an EC2 instance within the VPC.
